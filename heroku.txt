Use the following command to check if your machine has the heroku-cli installed:

    $ heroku

While in your application directory...

    # Make sure you have a git tracker created for your application

        $ git status
        #   if you haven't tracked your application with git...  #
        $ git init
        
    # Enter your Heroku credentials

        $ heroku login

    # Create a git remote for Heroku for your application

        $ heroku create

    # Copy the git remote URL that was returned to you. 

        Should look something like:
        git@heroku.com:awesome-possum-8408.git

    # Link the remote directory to your local repository

        $ git remote add heroku <your-heroku-remote-url-goes-here>

    # Push your local repository/application to the Heroku remote/directory

        $ git push heroku master

    # Heroku takes care of the rest! Let's check out the application!

        $ heroku open

    # To be precise, when you push up to Heroku, Heroku will read your package.json to install the correct dependencies, and run the correct scripts once it's deployed.
